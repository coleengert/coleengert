- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @coleengert
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in fungal biotechnology, chemistry, and microbial cell factories... but this page is dedicated to none of those things. Instead, in an
attempt to heighten my python skills, I am developing a game essentially from scratch, using only Python and PyGame. Given my complete lack of formal training, I am proud of my progress so far, but a long journey remains before the game is finished, or even enjoyable.
- I am not an artist by any means. Please do not judge the game on the art assets, which are also original creations. They are merely doodles that make my brain
hoot with simian joy.
